Libft is the first project at 42.
The goal is to re-create a custom C standard library, implementing essential functions for memory manipulation, strings, linked lists, and more.

Key Features

- Re-implementation of standard C library functions (memcpy, atoi, strlcpy, etc.)

- Additional utility functions for:

   - String manipulation
   -  Memory handling
   -  Character checks
   -  Linked list operations (t_list)

- Fully tested and compliant with 42’s norm.

Highlights

- Built from scratch without using <string.h> or <stdlib.h> equivalents
- Strong focus on robustness and defensive programming
- Provides a foundation for future projects like Printf and Get Next Line
